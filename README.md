The application is designed to interact with a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It has the ability to read the spreadsheet, fetch the necessary data, perform calculations, and then write the results back to the spreadsheet.

This is achieved by leveraging the Google Sheets API, a powerful tool provided by Google. The Google Sheets API allows applications to interact with Google Sheets programmatically. It provides the ability to read data from a spreadsheet, write data to a spreadsheet, and manage the spreadsheet itself.

## 💡 Building

<br/>

The project was developed using Node.js and TypeScript, incorporating several libraries such as GoogleAPI, ora, tsx, dotenv, among others. The architecture of the project was carefully designed to ensure efficiency and maintainability. The goal of this project is to interact seamlessly with Google Sheets, performing operations like reading data, performing calculations, and writing results back to the spreadsheet. This makes it a versatile tool for any application that needs to work with spreadsheet data.
